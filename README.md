# HOS: Home Operating System

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tmguvenc/HOS.svg?branch=master](https://travis-ci.org/tmguvenc/HOS.svg?branch=master)
Open source operating system for home that people can "use" as they want to. 

###Basic principles:
  * Make life easier for humans, not harder
  * Learn by yourself and require minimum human attention
  * Provideo at least basic level of security
  * Remember that you are not Windows OS, so don't over-consume your resources, try to minimize it
	
This system is far from perfect, but I have faith :)
