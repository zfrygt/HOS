# HOS: Home Operating System
Open source operating system for home that people can "use" as they want to. 

##Basic principles:
	* Make life easier for humans, not harder
	* Learn by yourself and require minimum human attention
	* Give a specific level of security for humans
	* Remember that you are not Windows OS, so don't over-consume your resources, try to minimize it
	
This system is far from perfect, but I have faith :)
